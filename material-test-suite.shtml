<h1>Material Test Suite</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom:1em">The Material Test Suite for Oolite 1.74 is an expansion pack which tests Oolite’s material model and built-in shaders. We request that as many people as possible try out the test suite, on as many machines as they can – within reason – and on multiple operating systems if practical.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:1em">To run the test suite:</p><ul style="margin-bottom:1em">
<li> <a href="http://jens.ayton.se/oolite/files/material-test-suite-oxp.zip">Download the test sute</a> and install it. (For information on installing expansion packs, see <a href="http://wiki.alioth.net/index.php/OXP#Installing_an_OXP">the OXP article on Elite Wiki</a>.)</li>
<li> Run Oolite 1.74, and decline when asked whether you want to start a new game. (If you are using Strict Mode, disable it and restart Oolite.)</li>
<li> You should now be presented with an information screen and the options “Run test suite” and “Cancel”. Select “Run test suite”.</li>
<li> You will now be shown a series of spinning cubes. The precise number shown depends on your system’s capabilities. A successfull test shows a grey box with a number on it. (The details vary; for instance, for test #13 the number is only visible as a shiny reflection at certain angles.) A failed test will show something else, typically a solid black box.</li>
<li> Please take a note of any failed tests, writing down the label shown on the left of the screen (such as “simple: 3”). If it is something other than a sold black or red box, please also take a screen shot (“*” key).</li>
<li> While you’re at it, we’d appreciate if you tested dust rendering. When the test suite is complete, leave the station and fly away until you are no longer mass locked. Fly at normal speed and at hyperspeed (default: “J” key). Note whether you see dust particles flying past. Test this in every available shader mode (to change shader mode, pause, press “2” or “F2”, and select “Game Options…”).</li></ul>

<p style="margin-bottom:1em">If all the tests work and dust is nicely dusty, we’re done. You can throw out the Material Test Suite expansion pack and get back to playing the game. Otherwise, please report the problem:</p>
<ul style="margin-bottom:1em"><li> Quit Oolite and open the log file. (To locate the log file, see <a href="http://wiki.alioth.net/index.php/Oolite_FAQ#Diagnosing_Problems">the FAQ entry on diagnosing problems</a>.)</li>
<li> Copy the lines between “<code>========== [Marker 1] ==========</code>” and “<code>========== [Marker 2] ==========</code>”. Paste them into an e-mail to <a href="mailto:bugs@oolite.org">bugs@oolite.org</a> or <a href="http://www.aegidian.org/bb/viewtopic.php?t=8038">this forum thread</a> (or send the whole log as an attachment). Don’t forget to specify which tests failed!</li></ul>

<p>If your tests passed, feel free to report anyway. Confirmation that we’re doing something right is good for our ego. But if they failed, we really need to know. We can’t fix problems we don’t know about.</p>
